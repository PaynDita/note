to generate an SSL certificate for any exe or bat file payloads so that he might be able to establish a connection with the host through the meterpreter session.
The firewall spoof the network traffic and verifies trust certificates to establish connection itself as a trusted third party to the session between the client and the server. When the client begins with an SSL session 
with the server, the firewall captures the client SSL request and forwards the SSL request to the server. The server sends a certificate for the client that is captured by the firewall. If the server certificate is signed
by a CA that the firewall trusts, the firewall generates a duplicate of the server certificate signed by the Forward Trust certificate and forward the certificate to the client to authenticate. 

Meterpreter_Paranoid_Mode.sh allows users to secure your staged/stageless connection for Meterpreter by having it check the certificate of the handler it is connecting to.
