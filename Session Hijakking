sometimes also known as cookie hijacking is the exploitation of a valid computer session—sometimes also called session key—to gain unauthorized access to information or services in a computer system.
In particular, it is used to refer to the theft of a magic cookie used to authenticate a user to a remote server. It has particular relevance to web developers, as the HTTP cookies used to maintain a session on many web sites
can be easily stolen by an attacker using an intermediary computer or with access to the saved cookies on the victim’s computer.
