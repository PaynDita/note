-sC or --script
--script-trace and --script-updatedb, are generally only used for script debugging and development. Script scanning is also included as part of the -A (aggressive scan) option.

/usr/share/nmap/scripts

root:/usr/share/nmap/scripts$ file scripts.db
root:/usr/share/nmap/scripts$ head scripts.db
root:/usr/share/nmap/scripts$ grep "ftp" /usr/share/nmap/scripts/scripts.db
root:/usr/share/nmap/scripts$ ls -l /usr/share/nmap/scripts/*ftp*

same for catagory:
root:/usr/share/nmap/scripts$ grep "safe" /usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db


To run a script scan with neither a host discovery nor a port scan, use the -Pn -sn options together with -sC or --script. Every host will be assumed up and still only host scripts will be run.
This technique is useful for scripts like whois-ip that only use the remote system's address and don't require it to be up.

nmap -sC example.com
A simple script scan using the default set of scripts.

nmap -sn -sC example.com
A script scan without a port scan; only host scripts are eligible to run.

nmap -Pn -sn -sC example.com
A script scan without host discovery or a port scan. All hosts are assumed up and only host scripts are eligible to run.

nmap --script smb-os-discovery --script-trace example.com
Execute a specific script with script tracing.

nmap --script snmp-sysdescr --script-args creds.snmp=admin example.com
Run an individual script that takes a script argument.

nmap --script mycustomscripts,safe example.com
Execute all scripts in the mycustomscripts directory as well as all scripts in the safe category.

safe:- Won't affect the target
intrusive:- Not safe: likely to affect the target
vuln:- Scan for vulnerabilities
exploit:- Attempt to exploit a vulnerability
auth:- Attempt to bypass authentication for running services (e.g. Log into an FTP server anonymously)
brute:- Attempt to bruteforce credentials for running services
discovery:- Attempt to query running services for further information about the network (e.g. query an SNMP server).






nmap -sS (only work with Sudo and in sudo by default nmap run syn scan while TCP connect scan run by default if its normal mode)
syn - half_scan or stealth | TCP connect - full scan
send rst after getting ACK | send ack after getting ack
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For UDP as it takes long time best practice is to scan with top ports number
nmap -sU --top-ports 20 <target>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NULL|FIN|Xmas interlinked and are used primarily as they tend to be even stealthier, relatively speaking, than a SYN "stealth" scan.
NULL scans (-sN) are when the TCP request is sent with no flags set at all. As per the RFC, the target host should respond with a RST if the port is closed. Empty packets

FIN scans (-sF) work in an almost identical fashion; however, instead of sending a completely empty packet, a request is sent with the FIN flag (usually used to gracefully close an active connection)

Xmas scans (-sX) send a malformed TCP packet and expects a RST response for closed ports. It's referred to as an xmas scan as the flags that it sets (PSH, URG and FIN) give it the appearance of a blinking christmas tree when viewed as a packet capture in Wireshark.

ping sweep, we use the -sn switch (NMAP send ICMP packets) in conjunction with IP ranges which can be specified with either a hypen (-) or CIDR notation. i.e. we could scan the 192.168.0.x network using:

nmap -sn 192.168.0.1-254 or nmap -sn 192.168.0.0/24
The -sn switch tells Nmap not to scan any ports

-- forcing it to rely primarily on ICMP echo packets (or ARP requests on a local network, if run with sudo or directly as the root user) to identify targets.
In addition to the ICMP echo requests, the -sn switch will also cause nmap to send a TCP SYN packet to port 443 of the target, as well as a TCP ACK (or TCP SYN if not run as root) packet to port 80 of the target.
