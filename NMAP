nmap -sS (only work with Sudo and in sudo by default nmap run syn scan while TCP connect scan run by default if its normal mode)
syn - half_scan or stealth | TCP connect - full scan
send rst after getting ACK | send ack after getting ack

For UDP as it takes long time best practice is to scan with top ports number
nmap -sU --top-ports 20 <target>
