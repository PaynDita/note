nmap -sS (only work with Sudo and in sudo by default nmap run syn scan while TCP connect scan run by default if its normal mode)
syn - half_scan or stealth | TCP connect - full scan
send rst after getting ACK | send ack after getting ack

For UDP as it takes long time best practice is to scan with top ports number
nmap -sU --top-ports 20 <target>



NULL|FIN|Xmas interlinked and are used primarily as they tend to be even stealthier, relatively speaking, than a SYN "stealth" scan.
NULL scans (-sN) are when the TCP request is sent with no flags set at all. As per the RFC, the target host should respond with a RST if the port is closed. Empty packets

FIN scans (-sF) work in an almost identical fashion; however, instead of sending a completely empty packet, a request is sent with the FIN flag (usually used to gracefully close an active connection)

Xmas scans (-sX) send a malformed TCP packet and expects a RST response for closed ports. It's referred to as an xmas scan as the flags that it sets (PSH, URG and FIN) give it the appearance of a blinking christmas tree when viewed as a packet capture in Wireshark.
